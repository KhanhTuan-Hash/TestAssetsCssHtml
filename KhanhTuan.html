<h2> LAS VEGAS , A Railroad Town </h2>

<h3>Las Vegas was first founded in May 1905, when 110 acres of land was sold by the Los Angeles and Salt Lake railroad company.</h3>

<h3>It only took a year for the very first casino to open, Golden Gate, a hotel-casino which was located at 1 Fremont Street. </h3>
           <img src = "assets/img/Slider12.jpg" > 
<h3>Back in these early days you could get both room and board for a single dollar. 

   <h3> Las Vegas, which was still just a railroad town at this time, voted to become incorporated on June 1, 1911.
    
    <h3>For 20 years Las Vegas remained a relatively quiet place. But then, in 1931, two things kickstarted its transformation into the busy city we all know today.</h3>
    
    <h3>First among these were changes to the area’s divorce laws. This meant that anyone who had been a resident of Las Vegas for six weeks could file for divorce, which led to many “divorce tourists” visiting the city. </h3>
    
    <h3>1931 also saw the construction of the Hoover Dam beginning just east of Las Vegas.</h3>
    
    <h3>This attracted thousands of workers to the city and led to casinos and other entertainment venues opening along the length of Fremont Street. </h3>
